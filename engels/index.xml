&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-autobiography-of-ricardo-coenen:b8ba8b1fcf0c24f1bbf715390a897859&#34;&gt;IT-Autobiography of Ricardo Coenen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome reader, I&amp;rsquo;m Ricardo Coenen, student at the Immaculata Institute and currently studying IT-management. I&amp;rsquo;m the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;fixer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. When someone has a question or something is broken, they ask me for help, most of the time. I will not continue in IT-management after this year, I hope to join the police or army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 10 when I started playing with computers. I got an old computer from my mother and I started googling, investigating and tried a lot of things. At a certain point I searched the web, and found that you can hack other people. At that moment, my mother met a new partner and he taught me everything I needed to know. You can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how happy I was about being able to hack a site. He told me that I can only use that &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; for skills or good things, not bad things. So over all these years, I am learning a lot of computers, not just from Google, but a lot from my stepfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And still, I can learn from my stepfather. I still learn something new from him every week. IT means so much for me now. I sometimes think about it, and what would have become of me when my mother hadn&amp;rsquo;t met my step-dad. When I&amp;rsquo;m home, I&amp;rsquo;m behind my computer most of the time. It&amp;rsquo;s relaxing for me, as football can be relaxing for someone else. When working on my computer, I like building sites, expanding our network, building server in our network, etc&amp;hellip; . I think I&amp;rsquo;m lucky that my dad let me all do it, he even pays new stuff so I can experiment with new devices, software and hardware. At the moment I don&amp;rsquo;t game much, but when I play a game, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly fps-games. I have made multiple networks, repaired computers, hosted servers and designed multiple sites of which I still manage one . The site is still under construction, but it has already been published. I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself as an expert, but I think I can say I know a lot of the basic stuff of IT and pretty much of hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself programming software or building networks. I hope I can join the police or army, if not, I would like to learn everything about hacking. I know there is a school which specialises in hacking, but unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s a school in a foreign country. I know there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of business in the IT-security industry, because nowadays, everything is online, and everything is hackable, so there will always be a need for IT-security. I just hope I will never have to look at a screen every day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
